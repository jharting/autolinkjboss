Autolink for JBoss
==================

Simple userscript to enable automatic linking of email, twitter, plain text urls and more importantly JBoss jira links.

This allows you to just refer to Jira bugid's and not full urls in things like Github.

How to install
==============

This is an userscript so any form of Greasemonkey browser variation should work.

For Chrome the simplest is:

   1) Open (Chrome Extension Page)[chrome://chrome/extensions/] via Window -> Extensions.

   2) Drag autolinkjboss.userscript.js to this page

   3) Approve the dialog 

   4) You can now visit pages and it should start working.
